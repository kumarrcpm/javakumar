<p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, web design, web content development, and e-commerce development.</p>

<p>Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the Internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet. Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers. When Internet users want to view your website, all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser. Their computer will then connect to your server and your webpages will be delivered to them through the browser.</p>

<p>Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) is an online advertising platform developed by Google, where advertisers bid to display brief advertisements, service offerings, product listings, or videos to web users. It can place ads both in the results of search engines like Google Search (the Google Search Network) and on non-search websites, mobile apps, image ads, shopping ads and video ads on YouTube</p>
<br>
<p>Social Media Marketing is the use of social media platforms and websites to promote a product or service. Most social media platforms have built-in data analytics tools, enabling companies to track the progress, success, and engagement of ad campaigns. Companies address a range of stakeholders through social media marketing, including current and potential customers, current and potential employees, journalists, bloggers, and the general public. On a strategic level, social media marketing includes the management of a marketing campaign, governance, setting the scope (e.g. more active or passive use) and the establishment of a firm’s desired social media “culture” and “tone.” When using social media marketing, firms can allow customers and Internet users to post user-generated content (e.g., online comments, product reviews, etc.), also known as “earned media,” rather than use marketer-prepare advertising copy.</p>
<br>
<p>E-commerce marketing is selling your company products through your own e-commerce website or selling on famous e-commerce websites like Myntra, Amazon, Flipkart, AJIO, Etsy etc for develop your company and products throughout the world</p>

<p>SEO stands for search engine optimization. Which is the art of ranking high on a search engine in the unpaid section, also known as the organic listings. Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of optimizing your online content so that a search engine likes to show it as a top result for searches of a certain keyword. When it comes to SEO, there’s you, the search engine, and the searcher. If you have an article about how to make mushroom, you want the search engine (which, in 90% of all cases, is Google) to show it as a top result to anyone who searches for the phrase “mushroom”. SEO is the magic you have to work on your article in order to make Google very likely to include your post as one of the top results whenever someone searches for that keyword</p>

<p>Cloud computing on Amazon web services (AWS) is one feature service from Sweet Solutions. Instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, people can access technology services, such as computing power, storage and databases on as- needed basis from a cloud provider. AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide a variety of basic abstract technical infrastructure and distributed computing building blocks and tools. One of these services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet. AWS’s version of virtual computers emulates most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).</p>
